## Information

Material for the Spatial Part of the course "_Advanced topics in single-cell transcriptomics_"

## Structure

* `data` - all data and files you need for this session
* `exercises` - jupyter notebooks and associated material
* `slides` - lecture slides


## Setup

The recommended setup is that you copy this directory (`spatial`) into your renku environment. Once this is done, you need to unzip the data files, to do so : In your renku environment open a terminal window and `cd` into the `data` folder. Then simply do enter

```sh

gunzip -r *

```

After this you should be ready to go! Open up the notebook called `Part 1` to get started.
