## Exploring an HDF5 file

To start with we're going to look at and HDF5 file produced by 10X Genomics (the original file is available from [here](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/2.1.0/pbmc8k)).  For the moment we aren't going to worry about the specifics of the 10X format, but use this file to demonstrate how you can take a look at the contents of any HDF5 file.

First, lets start with the function `h5ls()`:

```{r, h5ls}
h5ls(file = '../data/pbmc8k_raw_gene_bc_matrices_h5.h5')
```

The output from `h5ls()` gives us an overview of the structure of the file, without really showing us the content.  We can see `pbmc8k_raw_gene_bc_matrices_h5.h5` contains a single group (GRCh38) and within that group there are many datasets.  We can also see what type of data each dataset contains (the `dclass` column).

### Exercise

Use `h5ls()` to examine the other HDF5 files in the `data` folder.

## Reading from HDF5 files


```{r, h5dump}
pbmc8k_list <- h5dump("../data/new_brain.h5")
```

This list is quite large and isn't going to be used again in this tutorial, so I recommend removing it from your R session so you do not run out of RAM.

```{r, cleanup-1}
rm(pbmc8k_list)
```


```{r, pbmc1}
tenXdata <- h5read(file = '../data/pbmc8k_raw_gene_bc_matrices_h5.h5', name = "/GRCh38/data")
```


## Writing to HDF5 files

```{r, write-1}
ex_matrix <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 5, ncol = 2)
h5write(ex_matrix, "../data/my_hdf5.h5","example_matrix")
```


```{r h5delete1}
h5ls("../data/my_hdf5.h5", recursive=2)
file.size("../data/my_hdf5.h5")
```


```{r h5delete2}
h5delete(file = "../data/my_hdf5.h5", name = "example_matrix")
h5ls("../data/my_hdf5.h5", recursive=2)
file.size("../data/my_hdf5.h5")
```
