# 10X Genomics

Feature-barcode matrices 

```
genome
├── barcodes
├── data
├── gene_names
├── genes
├── indices
├── indptr
└── shape
```

### Exercise

Can you construct an R matrix from the data in the 10X file?

Most of the time you don't need to worry about the structure of these files, as you'll be using other software to read them.

```{r}

```


# HDF5Array

```{r}
library(HDF5Array)
library(DropletUtils)
library(LoomExperiment)
library(Seurat)
```



```{r}

```
