Single-cell datasets can be extremely large, but are typically also very sparse.  This sparsity provides a few options for storing and distributing single-cell count matrices in an efficient manner.  Generally this falls into one of two categories: 
- Store a sparse representation of the matrix by recording only the non-zero values and an index of which row and column the value comes from.  This relies on the matrix being sparse enough, that the cost of storing the indices doesn't outweigh discarding the zero entries.
- Store the complete 2-dimensional matrix and rely on compression techniques to reduce the file size.  Here no additional data are stored, but for very sparse matrices the compression will not necessarily be as efficient as removing the zero values entirely.

It is of course possible to combine these approaches and compress a sparse representation, but the effect will be less dramatic.


# 10X Genomics

10X provide their count matrices (referred to as "Feature-barcode matrices") using the sparse representation.  The following is taken from the 10X documentation available (here)[https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/h5_matrices].


```
(root)
└── matrix [HDF5 group]
    ├── barcodes
    ├── data
    ├── indices
    ├── indptr
    ├── shape
    └── features [HDF5 group]
        ├─ _all_tag_keys
        ├─ feature_type
        ├─ genome
        ├─ id
        ├─ name
        ├─ pattern [Feature Barcoding only]
        ├─ read [Feature Barcoding only]
        └─ sequence [Feature Barcoding only]
```

| Column   | Description |
| --       | ------------ |
| barcodes | Barcode sequences |
| data     | Nonzero UMI counts in column-major order |
| indices  | Zero-based row index of corresponding element in data |
| indptr   | Zero-based index into data / indices of the start of each column, i.e., the data corresponding to each barcode sequence |
| shape    | Matrix dimensions (# rows, # columns) |

**It's worth noting that the exact file format has changed over time, and probably will continue to do so, to reflect changes in experimental protocols and software.  However the broad sparse matrix layout has remained consistent.  You can examples of 10X files generated with previous versions of Cell Ranger (here)[https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets]**

The file `neuron_1k_v3_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5` is an example of a feature / cell matrix produced by Cell Ranger 3.0.0, and we can verify that it's structure matches the schematic above using the `h5ls()` command we saw previously.  If you are provided with an HDF5 file of unknown provenance, an initial glance at the structure can often tell you a lot about how it was produced.

```{r, tenX-h5ls}
library(rhdf5)
h5ls("../data/on-disk-data/neuron_1k_v3_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5")
```

The sparse structure is efficient for storage and transfer, but not necessarily the easiest concept to work with directly.  It's likely that in your work you probably still want to interact with the counts as if they were a matrix with rows and columns.

```{r, chunk-layout-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Representing a matrix as three vectors in the compressed sparse column format', fig.show = 'hold', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/sparse_structure.png')
```

### Exercise

Can you construct an R matrix of counts from the data in the 10X file?  

Hints: 
    - You can read the whole file into a list with `h5dump()`
    - Note these indices are zero-based and R is one-based
    - The `shape` represents the final matrix dimensions
    - Items in `indptr` denote the start of 'blocks' of values in `indices` and `data` (there should be as many 'blocks' as there are columns)
    - `indptr` also includes the last element 
    - Values in `indices` correspond to rows in the appropriate column
    
You can verify your solution by checking the sums of the values in the first 10 columns - these should be:

`1023  7210  9883  5290 18676 20196   716  6448 16837  2065`

```{r}
## Insert your code here
```

Most of the time you don't need to worry about the structure of these files, as you'll be using other software to read them and you hope the others of that software keep up-to-date with any changes to the file structure.

```{r, reading-with-packages}
library(DropletUtils)
library(Seurat)
DropletUtils::read10xCounts("../data/on-disk-data/neuron_1k_v3_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5")
Seurat::Read10X_h5("../data/on-disk-data/neuron_1k_v3_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5")
```

# Complete dense matrix

Formats such as loom as well as many of the software tools found in Bioconductor use the alternative approach and store the entire 2-dimensional matrix, including zeros, on disk.

```{r}
h5ls('../data/on-disk-data/L1_DRG_20_example.loom', recursive = FALSE)
```

In cases like this we can directly read the data into an R matrix without any further processing.

```{r}
h5read('../data/on-disk-data/L1_DRG_20_example.loom', name = "matrix")
```

## Working only with arrays

If you're interested in performing operations on single HDF5 dataset the HDF5Array package provides a neat interface.  Many of the Bioconductor classes for representing single-cell data (e.g. SingleCellExperiment) make use of this.  Here the meta data (Sample names, genes, etc) are stored in memory, but the actual count matrix is held on disk.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(HDF5Array)
HDF5Array(filepath = '../data/on-disk-data/L1_DRG_20_example.loom', name = "matrix")
```

The HDF5Array package is also aware of the 10X sparse structure, and can read this directly.  **Note: the argument to specify where the counts are in the file is now 'group' rather than 'name', as multiple datasets are used in the 10X format.**.

```{r, hdf5array-tenx}
HDF5Array::TENxMatrix(filepath = "../data/on-disk-data/neuron_1k_v3_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5", group = "matrix")
```
